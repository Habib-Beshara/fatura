## Notes:
- Rename `.env.example` to `.env` after you change your env variables.
- You need to run `npm run db:migrate` to create the db and tables needed.
- You can run the service by using `npm start`.
- You can also run it using nodemon using `npm run dev`. This would require also `npm run build` which I used for development.
- To run the tests `npm run test`.
